FluxBB Redefined
================

## About
FluxBB Redefined is a redesign concept for FluxBB forum. The whole purpose of the project is to experiment enhancements and new concepts for FluxBB.

FluxBB's design has remained pretty much the same since the early start of the development and many parts are outdated and could be improved if not entirely rethinked. That's what we're doing here. FluxBB 2.0 will bring a complete new code, FluxBB Redefined aims to bring ideas for a complete (or not) redesign of the front-end and back-end.

## FluxxBB Redefined IS NOT:
 * A style/mod for FluxBB. 95% of what is done so far is impossible to implement on a standard FluxBB installation.
 * A proposition for integration in forthcoming FluxBB updates.
 * A simple adaptation of the current FluxBB design to Twitter Bootsrap.
 * A relooking of the current FluxBB design.

## FluxBB Redefined IS:
 * A full-scale rethinking of FluxBB front-end and back-end.
 * A testing tool for possible future extensions.
